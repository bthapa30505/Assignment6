In order to run the data structures and kth-item algorithms implemenations, following steps can be performed.
  1) Clone the repository to your local system.
  2) Open the project directory on your terminal
  3) Use the follwing commands to run the python files
    a) python3 data-structures.py
    b) python3 kth-item-selection.py

# Summary 
This project provided a good understanding of medians, order statistics, and elementary data structures. I implemented algorithms related to these topics and analyzed their performance as well as discussed their practical applications. By the end of this assignment, it has provided a good grasp of both the theoretical and practical aspects of these essential algorithmic concepts.
